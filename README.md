Tech Stack: Angular, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Firebase

Overview:
Developed during my internship at Funavry Technologies, Islamabad, this Book Management System is a full-stack web application built with Angular and Node.js. The app allows users to manage a collection of books, with features like CRUD operations, database integration, and responsive UI.

Responsibilities:

Designed and implemented the frontend using Angular.

Built the backend using Node.js/Express and connected it with MySQL.

Deployed the project live on Firebase hosting.

Note: Some sections (like profile settings) are placeholders and not fully functional, but core features are working.
